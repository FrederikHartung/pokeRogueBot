/**
 * Reinforcement Learning environment for training an agent to make optimal modifier selections
 * in PokeRogue gameplay scenarios.
 *
 * This environment simulates the modifier selection phase where players choose between various
 * items, upgrades, and healing options. The RL agent learns to make decisions that maximize
 * long-term survival and performance based on current party state and available resources.
 *
 * MDP Components:
 * - State: SmallModifierSelectState (party HP + resource availability)
 * - Action: Integer representing modifier choice index
 * - Reward: Based on survival improvement, resource efficiency, and strategic value
 *
 * Training Approach:
 * - Episodes represent modifier selection decisions during actual gameplay
 * - Rewards calculated based on subsequent battle performance and survival
 * - State transitions occur when new modifier choices become available
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Connects with existing ChooseModifierNeuron for decision making
 * - Uses current game state from browser integration
 * - Provides training data for improving modifier selection strategies
