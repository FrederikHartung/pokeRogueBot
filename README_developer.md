## Development Strategy
Focus on progress and not on perfection. It's better to stick to a bad implementation and improve it later than to try to make it perfect from the beginning.  
If a good idea comes up, write it down and implement it later. Focus on the current task. Order the tasks by their level of improvement and how easy they are to implement.  
Only refactor, when it's really necessary.
